# edge.microshift.app

This role deploys application onto a system running microshift.

## Requirements

The role requires a system to be running microshift which
the `edge.microshift.image_build` role will automate the creation of.

## Role Variables

### microshift_image_pull_secret

Type: file / string

Pull secret allows authentication with the container registries that serve the container images used by the official Red Hat supported MicroShift.

For downloading the pull secret from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, click [here](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret)

**Note:** If the pull secret is not on the microshift system then the pull secret will need to be set and defined in the playbook.
